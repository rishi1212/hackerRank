A weighted string is a string of lowercase English letters where each letter has a weight in the inclusive range from to , defined below:

We define the following terms:

The weight of a string is the sum of the weights of all the string's characters. For example:

A uniform string is a string consisting of a single character repeated zero or more times. For example, ccc and a are uniform strings, but bcb and cd are not (i.e., they consist of more than one distinct character).
Given a string, , let  be the set of weights for all possible uniform substrings (contiguous) of string . You have to answer  queries, where each query  consists of a single integer, . For each query, print Yes on a new line if ; otherwise, print No instead.

Note: The  symbol denotes that  is an element of set .

Input Format

The first line contains a string denoting  (the original string).
The second line contains an integer denoting  (the number of queries).
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains an integer denoting  (the weight of a uniform subtring of  that may or may not exist).

Constraints

 will only contain lowercase English letters.
Output Format

For each , print Yes on a new line if ; otherwise, print No instead.

Explanation 0

The weights of every possible uniform substring in the string abccddde are shown below:

We print Yes on the first four lines because the first four queries match weights of uniform substrings of . We print No for the last two queries because there are no uniform substrings in  that have those weights.

Note that while de is a substring of  that would have a weight of , it is not a uniform substring.

Note that we are only dealing with contiguous substrings. So ccc is not a substring of the string ccxxc.
